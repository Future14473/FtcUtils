# FtcUtils

Common FTC specific library code for Future14473, featuring:

- Adapters from the FTC SDK to Future14473/JARGON
    - Special thanks to OpenFTC for hardware/robotcore stock
- Kotlin Coroutine OpModes! (Kotlin Coroutines: the subjectively best concurrency model ever)

Requires JARGON publishToMavenLocal to work.

Right now can only use via publishToMavenLocal, too.

This is public, feel free to use anything.

This may be repackaged and published more officially in the _Future_.
